<h1>The Independent Osprey</h1>
<p>This Independent Osprey has been a seasonal occupant of a nest in Independence, Oregon.</p>

<h3>by late summer of 2020...</h3>

...a mature female osprey had spent her QQQth season on the nest overlooking QQQ park in Indepence, Oregon in 2020.  Her mate disappeared before fertilizing her three eggs.  Two or more other suitors competed for her attention later in the season.  She remained on the nest regularly until QQQ before relocating to a nearby tree and then departing for her annual migration in QQQ.  If successful, she is expected to return some time in QQQ.  Visitors to a webcam-based streaming video of the nest called her "Olga."
The nest was relocated in QQQ in preparation for construction of The Independence Hotel which co-operates with Pacific Power and the City of Independence, Oregon to preserve it as well as to allow close, non-intrusive observation of the nest by the public via the live streaming webcam channel.  <img src="i/OlgaTheIndpependentOsprey.JPG" alt="Olga Stands Tall."  style="float: left;width:256px;height:256px;margin-top:5px;margin-right:15px;margin-bottom:5px">
Cheryl Gaston, an enthusiastic and dedicated student of the osprey, acted as close, regular observer nest and docent for the text chat accompanying the streaming video of the nest.  Several regular participants in that chat contributed their enthusiasm, curiosity and knowledge for the benefit of the group.
The 2021 season is sure to bring an exciting return of raptors to tbe QQQ park osprey nest in Indepence, Oregon.
